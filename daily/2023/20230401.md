# Meta AI Ecosystem Management Metrics

4 types of metrics 
* model metrics - the performance and accuracy of AI models
* ecosystem metrics - impact on the wider ecosystem, e.g. energy consumption and compatibility with other systems
* safety metrics - risks associated with AI systems, e.g. vulnerability to attacks and potential impact on human safety
* fairness metrics - impact on different groups of people, such as potential for bias or discrimination

Things to consider

* Data governance
* Security
* Ownership accountability
* Fairness
* Robustness
* Efficiency
##Decentralized AI ecosystem


Are all my models are retrained regularly?
1. model source code is writtern by engineers to solve a given purpose.
2. one or more model binaries are trained from this source
3. often being created periodically for either iterative model impovements or retraining
4. some of these versions are published to inference systems as deployments to serve traffic

2 key elements of consolidation 
* metadata graph
* data interoperability standards

AI metadata graph,
* a database  stores asset metadata and connections. Markers on connections to denote as 1 or 1-to-n
* graph is implemented via [Ent - schema as Code in Go](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2021/04/26/eli5-ent-schema-as-code-go/)
