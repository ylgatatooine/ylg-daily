[Databerry](https://github.com/gmpetrov/databerry) provides a user-friendly solution to quickly setup a semantic search system over your personal data without any technical knowledge.

Databerry let you bring data from anywhere (Datsources: Text, PDF, Word, PowerPpoint, Excel, Notion, Airtable, Google Sheets, etc..) into Datastores (container of multiple Datasources). Then your Datastores can be connected to ChatGPT via Plugins or any other Large Langue Model (LLM) via the Databerry API.
Databerry is made for ChatGPT users, developers, low-coders, no-coders
